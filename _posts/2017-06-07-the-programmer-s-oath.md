> Here are the 9 promises of Uncle Bob’s Programmer’s Oath, from his original 2015 blog post:
> 
> 1. I will not produce harmful code.
> 
> 2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
> 
> 3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
> 
> 4. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.
> 
> 5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
> 
> 6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
> 
> 7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
> 
> 8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
> 
> 9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
> 
> This is just the beginning. As software powers more and more of the world, developer ethics will become increasingly important.

The Programmer's Oath is something we strive to live by here at Flybase, all our code is written so that anyone can jump in and take over at anytime.

Since the guys at [freecodecamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-programmers-oath-db782efd958b) posted a new take a on it today, I thought I'd share both the oath and their post.

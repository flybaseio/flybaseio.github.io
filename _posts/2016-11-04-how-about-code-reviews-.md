> Last time, we talked about empathy and what goes into good pull requests. This time, let’s talk about the other side of the equation: what makes a good code review?
> 
> Why are we doing this?
> 
> First, it’s important to remember why we’re bothering with pull requests and code reviews in the first place.
> 
> They offer us an opportunity to share and explain our work.
> 
> They give us a place for feedback.
> 
> They demonstrate that we are responsibly managing which code we ship to our users.
> 
> They give us a chance to teach (by introducing people to a new part of the code) and learn (by receiving feedback).
> 
> Each of those reasons is different, but the same strategies are important for all of them.

This post from the Slack Engineering blog was from February but I wanted to share it now as code reviews are a handy thing to do from time to time. You'd be surprised what you can learn from your code when you have other people review it.

Claire Lew:

> I hate the word “empowerment.”
> 
> I never think I should “empower” anyone — especially our employees.
> 
> Why? The definition of the word “empower” is:
> 
> > to give power to (someone); to make (someone) stronger and more confident.
> 
> The key words here are “give” and “make.” Empowerment means you’re transferring power to someone else. You think someone else needs you — your permission, your influence, your talents — to do something. And I don’t ever believe that’s the case.
> 
> Our employees don’t need me to do anything.
> 
> When it comes to motivation, everything people need they already have inside them. Each person has something unique, special and important to offer the world. And as a leader, it’s my job to merely create the best environment that allows them to come into that themselves.

> Consumer products are sold off the shelf with minimal customization and the same is happening in software.

> That’s quite a change for someone like me who has spent 15 years selling to enterprise businesses and learning how to work for sales-driven organizations. A common refrain when talking to the product team in the early days of my career was: “I sold it, now go build it.”

> It’s a breath of fresh air working for a product-driven company like [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/). And it’s certainly a new experience working with a research team who join salespeople on calls to truly understand our customers.

> With all these changes in the space, including the continuing fall in average deal sizes, I’ve found that many of my colleagues have a background in consumer products. As a result there’s been many internal discussions about what are the fundamental differences between a B2C company and a B2B company these days?

Interesting post, worth reading for any product-driven company.

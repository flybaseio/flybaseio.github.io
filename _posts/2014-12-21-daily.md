> There's a fundamental difference between the things you do every day, every single day, and the things you do only when the spirit moves you.
> 
> One difference is that once you've committed to doing something daily, you find that the spirit moves you, daily.
> 
> Rather than having a daily debate about today's agenda, you can decide once that you will do something, and then decide every single day how to do it.

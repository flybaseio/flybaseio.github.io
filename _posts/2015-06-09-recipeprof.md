Over the weekend, [RecipeProf](http://recipeprof.com) was released in the [iOS app store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/recipeprof/id994924215?mt=8&uo=6), with an Android version launching [soon](http://recipeprof.com).

RecipeProf is an [AppGyver](http://appgyver.com), angular.js driven mobile app using Data McFly to store all of it's recipes and food information.

Users can use RecipeProf to search for recipes, or add their own recipes and get a nutritional breakdown of each ingredient. This is handy for knowing what you are eating and whether you should have that extra helping of desert.

All recipes and ingredients are stored on Data McFly, and users can then search based on recipes and ingredients, when users save or create recipes, these are stored locally currently, we'll be adding accounts and support for multiple devices in an upcoming update since that is what Data McFly is perfect for.

> Fast forward; It’s the year 2020 (or sooner!)…
> 
> I woke up this morning and grabbed the nearest screen. I selected my transportation for the day, refills of groceries I am running low on, what sandwich I want for lunch, a time window for my apartment to be cleaned, a dry-cleaning pick-up, and a reservation for dinner. I also selected a gift for my sister’s birthday, from a suggested list curated for me. After a productive 5 minutes, I got up and had breakfast.
> 
> You may assume I used Uber, and then Fresh Direct or Amazon Fresh, and then Seamless, and other speciality apps and services striving to iron out the logistics from my life. Maybe I did, but I’m not sure. Why? Because I took all these actions through a beautiful and customized interface that aggregates such services and blends them all together into a more integrated and frictionless experience.
> 
> Behind the scenes, there were APIs at play, along with a host of partnerships and affiliate programs brokered between the logistics and utility companies that provide such services and a new breed of companies that operate in the “Interface Layer.” The underlying logistics companies, once consumer-facing, now aggressively compete and optimize their offerings (and prices) for inclusion in the interfaces we use to manage our lives.
> 
> The customer experience of these service companies, once represented by dozens of apps — each with their own interface — has been replaced by the single layer we now use to access them.

Seth Godin:

> Anything worth shouting about is worth shouting into the wind.
> 
> Because if enough people care, often enough, the word spreads, the standards change, the wind dies down. If enough people care, the culture changes.
> 
> It's easy to persuade ourselves that the right time to make change happen is when it's time. But that's never true. The right time to make it happen is before it's time. Because this is what 'making' means.
> 
> The most devastating thing we can learn about our power is how much of it we have. How much change we could make if we would only speak up first, not last. How much influence we can have if we're willing to to look someone in the eye and say, "yes." Or, "this is our problem, too." Or, "this must stop."
> 
> Yes, there's wind, there's always been wind. But that doesn't mean we should stop shouting.

I wanted to share this because it's along the lines of my personal motto: `R.E.V.O` or `Realize Every Victory Outright`, which was also the title of one of my favourite [CDs](http://www.walkofftheearth.com/music/revo) to come out in a while.

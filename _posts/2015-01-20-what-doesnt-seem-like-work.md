Paul Graham:

> If something that seems like work to other people doesn’t seem like work to you, that’s something you’re well suited for.

Paul hits it right on the nose with this quote. Working with Data McFly, building our API and service, it's something we love, and enjoy working on. Seeing the types of apps that can be built with our service, makes us want to come to work every day and really doesn't seem at all like work.

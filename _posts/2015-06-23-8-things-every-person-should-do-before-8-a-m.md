Benjamin Hardy:

> Life is busy. It can feel impossible to move toward your dreams. If you have a full-time job and kids, it’s even harder.
> 
> How do you move forward?
> 
> If you don’t purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve — without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives. Before you know it, you’ll be old and withered — wondering where all that time went.
> 
> As Professor Harold Hill has said —

> > “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.”

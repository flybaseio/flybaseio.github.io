Jason Fried:

> Attend enough startup conferences or listen to enough motivational speakers and you’ll hear one piece of advice repeated over and over again: You’ve got to love what you do! If you don’t love what you do, you might as well stay home. No less a giant than Steve Jobs famously told Stanford’s 2005 graduating class, “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.”

> I don’t buy it.

Every project I've been involved in since starting in software development in 1999 has been along this path.

Running Data McFly is doing something I love, building a service that can benefit developers of all sizes and skill levels motivates me every morning to jump out of bed and see what we can do next. Even when it's a day of paperwork and reporting, it's still doing something I enjoy doing everyday. 

And I have to say that I love this job. :)

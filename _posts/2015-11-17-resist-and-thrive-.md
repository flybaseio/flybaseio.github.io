Yancey Strickler:

> This is a talk about what happens when a culture is driven by the need for money to make more money.
> 
> A simple way to think about this is through real estate. Throughout history it has been advantageous to be a land owner, and today is no different. People make a lot of money buying, developing, and selling land. Even after the crash of 2008, commercial real estate has climbed again.
> 
> As investors and developers churn through properties, there’s a significant impact on the communities that actually live and work there. For families and neighborhood businesses, they must significantly increase how much money they make or they have to leave. 
> 
> No matter their importance to their community, they can’t stay if they can’t pay. And few can.

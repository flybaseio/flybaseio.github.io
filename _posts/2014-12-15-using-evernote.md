> I believe that the best insights are made possible when they’re built from the best knowledge available. Discovering that information gets easier and easier every single day. Medium has become my go-to resource for war stories from the startup community. Twitter, of course, is my source of quality real-time news. Quora is my first move when I need a complex question answered.

> But I’ve always struggled to hold on to that knowledge once I’ve found it. My brain stores thoughts about as well as my hands hold water, and it took me years to finally find a tool which was up to the task. That tool, of course, is **Evernote**.

We use Evernote daily here at Data McFly, from storing notes and tasks to outlines for new posts.

It is a tool that I always recommend to people.

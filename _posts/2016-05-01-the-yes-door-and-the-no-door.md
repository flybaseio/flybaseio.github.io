> Feeling suffocated by your to-do list? When you’re running a business it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. So many demands, emails, questions, plans, proposals, money to chase, calls to follow up. So many decisions. There’s more to do than you have time for, and it’s easy to get into a situation where you feel like you’re running to stand still, or even to slip backwards.
> 
> We’ve come to realize through many years of getting it not quite right, that a lot of it comes down to making better decisions. Say ‘yes’ to something, and you open the door to whole stream of demands. Say ‘no’ and you have the time to do something else.
> 
> Some doors are easy to open — fantastic new client when you have the capacity to do a great job — yes please, come on in. Work that brings out the best in you — yes. Opportunities that lead to other doors you’re keen to open — yes, those too. You know the extra work will be worthwhile, and you’re happy to do it. Choose happiness.

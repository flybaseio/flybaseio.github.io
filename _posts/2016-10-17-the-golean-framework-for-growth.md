Ash Maurya:

> GOLEAN? No this isn’t some blatant battlecry for going lean. It’s a mnemonic for a growth framework I created for my last book: Scaling Lean — one that draws heavily on lean startup principles and systems thinking:
> 
> - Goal 
> - Observe and Orient 
> - Leverage 
> - Experiment 
> - Analyze 
> - Next Action

Ash has an interesting take on the usual Build-Measure-Learn loop which is actually pretty close to how we do everything here at Flybase.

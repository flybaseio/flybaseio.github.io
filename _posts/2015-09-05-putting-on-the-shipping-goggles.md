Jason Fried:

> One of the biggest challenges of shipping a product is knowing when to put on the shipping goggles.
> 
> The shipping goggles make you less sensitive to little nits and scrapes and things that might be able to be a little bit better, but really don’t need to be right now. Stuff that we could tweak, but really shouldn’t be grabbing our attention given all the other high value bits we need to hit.
> 
> It’s sort of like squinting – you lose the detail, but you can still see the overall big picture shape, form, and function. Your peripheral vision shrinks, but the center is still bright.
> 
> Knowing when to squint is a good thing to know.
> 
> It’s not that the details don’t matter. They do, but details aren’t fixed – they’re relative. And of course any time you talk about details mattering, you’re speaking in very broad generalizations. 
> 
> Some matter, some don’t. Some never matter, some matter later, but not now. And some really matter now and can’t wait for later. Like everything, there are varying degrees.

This week seems to be the week for talking about shipping products.

It's a topic that is pretty spot on.

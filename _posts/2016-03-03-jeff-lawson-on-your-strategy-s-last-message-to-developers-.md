> APIs are a long commitment. Once you build them, they take time for developers to adopt and grow into revenue. You don’t put your enterprise sales team in the field and start closing $10M deals on launch day. You seed developers with ideas, you help them find use cases, and after developers build, you watch their apps go from prototypes, to betas, to production systems with happy customers. It requires patience and deep commitment, but when developers succeed with your API, you succeed.

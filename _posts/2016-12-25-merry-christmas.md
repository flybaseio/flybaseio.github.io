As another year comes to a close, we wanted to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in 2017.

As we enter our third year of operation, we like to reflect back on the previous years and think about what we've done, and what we have planned for the new year and it makes us happy to think of all we're bringing to you, our users.

We've seen a lot of growth as people realize what they can do with Flybase, and as we bring on our nextgen set of features, people will be able to do even more.

We mentoned [before](https://blog.flybase.io/2016/09/22/nextgen-features/) about our roll out of nextgen features, and we are 
starting to roll these out now.

We've rolled out the queues, and now this week we've launched our schema builder.

This is a very basic schema builder, after you've added a few records to a collection, you can set rules for each field, such as 
field types (number, string or mixed), index rules such as unique or required (or unique and required).

This gives you more control over your data, and also cuts down on doing things like searching to see if a record exists before adding it, now you just save it and that was it.

Some other rules coming will be the ability to auto-upsert a record if it's set to unique, but we're still testing that feature before we enable the checkbox for it.

> First of all, what is a JavaScript bundler? A JavaScript bundler is a tool that puts your code and all its dependencies together in one JavaScript file. There are many of them out there these days, being the most popular ones [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

There was no `import` or `require` statements. Now we have the new ES2015 import statement, but let’s ignore it by now because it is not widely implemented.

Interesting look at JavaScript bundlers. We're fans of browserify in here ourselves over webpack, but webpack is gaining steam.

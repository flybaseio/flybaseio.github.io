Cameron Moll:

> Years ago as a high school student I was driving to school and Bruce Springsteen came on the radio. Except he wasnâ€™t singing. He was answering questions from a local radio host.
> 
> At some point in the interview, Springsteen shared an uncanny observation about parents, paraphrased as best as I can I recall:
> 
> > The best way I know how to honor your parents is to take all their good attributes and incorporate them into who you are, and leave behind all the bad ones.
> 
> That observation has stuck with me for more than 20 years.

No one knows how to Boss like the Boss himself, Springsteen.

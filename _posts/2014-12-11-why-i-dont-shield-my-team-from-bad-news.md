Joel Gascoigne:

> I think there's an interesting concept that's prevalent, which **I believe could actually be quite dangerous**. It's the idea that as a CEO or executive of a company, you need to shield your team from bad news, the risks of a startup, and other negative aspects that are inevitable on the startup journey.
> 
> One of our [core values](http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04) at Buffer is to Default to Transparency. This means **absolutely everything in the company is shared knowledge**. It was scary at first, not least because the idea goes very much against the grain. I found myself hesitating, not because I genuinely could think of reasons not to share, but simply because no one else shares [some of the things we've shared](http://joel.is/why-we-have-a-core-value-of-transparency-at-our-startup/).

We're firm believers in Transparency as well here at Data McFly. I've seen companies that didn't believe in this and it's caused more than a few issues among the team members in the company.

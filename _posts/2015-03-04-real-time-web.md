We've been busy writing over here at Data McFly, not just blog posts and code, but the first Data McFly book as well.

[The Little Real-time Web Development Book](https://leanpub.com/real-time-web), is a short book which will walk you through an introduction to Data McFly and it's handy API, and then into building your first apps. We've divided the book into three sections:

1. Getting started with Data McFly and real-time web development
	- We'll cover how to get started with Data McFly
	- We'll then build our first basic real-time web app
	- Finally, we'll cover queries and custom events to learn how to control what data you display and when.
2. Building your Data McFly app without a server.
	- We'll build a social news app in Angular.JS with Data McFly.
	- Learn how to add user login and registration
	- Learn how to accept comments, and votes and update the home page to show the changes
	- Deploying your app to the web, you'll learn how to upload your Social news app to GitHub pages and host it for everyone to use.
	- We'll also cover briefly how to use your Angular.JS web app as a mobile app thanks to tools like Ionic and PhoneGap.
3. Integrating your Data McFly app into a node.js app
	- We'll take the app we built in section 2, and integrate it into a node.js app to give us extra server-side power such as:
		- RSS feeds, and RSS processing of external feeds to popular your social news site.
		- Social login integration with Github, Google+, Facebook and Twitter
		- Auto-tweeting to Twitter when new links are added to your news site.

When we're done, you'll have clear understanding of how real-time web development works, and be able to build whatever you need using Data McFly.

The book is a work in progress, but it's available for pre-order now with a discount, normally we're selling the book for $9.99, but as a pre-launch special, we are selling it for $6.99, this is a limited time so [Pre-order Now](http://leanpub.com/real-time-web/c/g4a89WtGTX9o), and get updates as we publish them to the book. We're using [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com), as our publishing platform, so any changes we make to the book, immediately get sent to you.

We're planning to write a series of smaller books for developing with Data McFly, rather than larger books. Our next planned book is using Data McFly and the Ionic Framework to build cross-platform mobile apps that run everywhere, and from there, we'll see what strikes us as being the next interesting topic to write about. ãƒ„

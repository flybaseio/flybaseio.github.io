This blog is in the middle of a redesign, but first we wanted to move it to a different setup, previously it ran on [Camel.js](https://github.com/DataMcFly/camel), but since the [Flybase home page](http://flybase.io/), [Docs site](http://docs.flybase.io) and various other Flybase-related projects all run on Jekyll, we decided to make the same move here as well.

Some features of Camel that we really like, such as the archives pages needed to be moved over, as well as the tags and the home page's grouping of posts by day, but those are all in place now, and we get a nice experience for it.

The new design will be rolling out shortly, which will really make the new engine shine.

At the same time, we still use Camel on other projects such as [my personal blog](http://rogerstringer.com/) and will continue to do so.

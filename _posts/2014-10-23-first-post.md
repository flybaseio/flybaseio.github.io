Welcome to the first post of the Data Mcfly blog.

We've decided to use [Camel](https://github.com/cliss/camel), with a continuous deployment via Github to Heroku as the blog engine for the Data McFly blog.

*What is Data McFly?*

Data McFly is a soon-to-launch real-time cloud data-storage service designed to be easy to use via our REST API.

Stayed tuned for more as we start on an exciting adventure :)

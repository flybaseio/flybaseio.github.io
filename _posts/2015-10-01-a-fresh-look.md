We've been quiet this week as we worked to get our new home page rolled out, we've got changes coming for our dashboard and this blog as well, but we wanted to get our home page updated first.

This is a layout that we're happy with, it helps you get the message and see what we do quickly.

This is also a move away from Bootstrap for us, our previous design was based in bootstrap, and while we have no problem with bootstrap, we wanted our new layout to use a different base.

On top of that, we've also rolled out our new logo, which we've been using here on this blog for a couple weeks now and have slowly been pushing it out in other areas.

We've got a few other announcements coming soon, so stay tuned! :)

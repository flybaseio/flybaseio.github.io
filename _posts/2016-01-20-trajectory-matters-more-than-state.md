Des Traynor:

> When you analyze your company it’s easy to look at everything in its current state.
> 
> What’s our biggest problem today? What’s our best asset today? That perspective is only useful if you don’t plan on being there tomorrow. It’s not about where you are, it’s where you’re headed.
> 
> Long term thinking is hard for a very simple reason: every company is in a race against the clock. Whether you’re bootstrapped or bankrolled, that clock is always ticking. Creating a product company requires an upfront investment of time and money and gives you a limited window to either break even, or show enough evidence of growth to secure funding. It’s hard to worry about future problems, when you have a hardwired focus on hitting a short term target.
> 
> But think of it this way, which deserves more attention: a big wound that’s healing, or a tiny tumour that’s growing? It’s not about where it is, it’s about where it’s going.

> When we started the Google Code project hosting service in 2006, the world of project hosting was limited. We were worried about reliability and stagnation, so we took action by giving the open source community another option to choose from. Since then, we’ve seen a wide variety of better project hosting services such as GitHub and Bitbucket bloom. Many projects moved away from Google Code to those other systems. To meet developers where they are, we ourselves migrated nearly a thousand of our own open source projects from Google Code to [GitHub](http://github.com/google).
> 
> As developers migrated away from Google Code, a growing share of the remaining projects were spam or abuse. Lately, the administrative load has consisted almost exclusively of abuse management. After profiling non-abusive activity on Google Code, it has become clear to us that the service simply isn’t needed anymore.
> 
> Beginning today, we have disabled new project creation on Google Code. We will be shutting down the service about 10 months from now on January 25th, 2016. Below, we provide links to migration tools designed to help you move your projects off of Google Code. We will also make ourselves available over the next three months to those projects that need help migrating from Google Code to other hosts.
> 
> - March 12, 2015 - New project creation disabled.
> - August 24, 2015 - The site goes read-only. You can still checkout/view project source, issues, and wikis.
> - January 25, 2016 - The project hosting service is closed. You will be able to download a tarball of project source, issues, and wikis. These tarballs will be available throughout the rest of 2016.

Google announced today that it is [closing its programming project hosting service](http://google-opensource.blogspot.jp/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html), Google Code, after nine years of operations. Google stopped users from creating new projects yesterday and will make existing projects read-only this August, ahead of a complete closure scheduled for January 25th, 2016. 

Google Code was created back in 2006, when project hosting options were limited, but since launch, it's seen a "wide variety of better project hosting services" such as [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) rise to the forefront.

I actually used to use Google Code for a few personal projects years ago, but once I signed up with [GitHub](https://github.com/freekrai), I moved all of my projects over there and haven't looked back. The same goes with the other developers here at Data McFly, and with most developers everywhere. But, it's still a little bittersweet to see this long-time project get shut down, since it seemed like it was always there.

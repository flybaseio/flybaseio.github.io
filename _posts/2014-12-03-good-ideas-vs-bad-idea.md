Allan Branch:

> Good ideas usually start with, “Wouldn’t it be cool _________?” They start with a playful suggestion of an idea you have. Usually when you say them aloud for the first time, you feel a brief moment of embarrassment. Then the other person says, “Yes and ____.”
> 
> **Yes and…**
> 
> “Yes and” comes from improv comedy. It’s a collaboration statement to build onto something more. It’s a trustful statement that means, “Here’s more…let’s see if this could work, let’s explore this.”

Nice advice, good ideas can be easy to miss sometimes.

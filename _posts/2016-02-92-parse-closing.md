Last week, Parse.com announced that they were going away in a year, what does that mean for developers who are already using Parse?

That means finding somewhere else to store your data.

Since the announcement last week, we've had people contact us about importing their data from their Parse apps and setting up their Cloud Code.

To help with this, we've made a Flybase adapter for Parse Server so data is stored on Flybase and the Parse client code stays the same, which means less work for developers to update their apps.

If you are an existing Parse user, [contact us](http://flybase.io/contact/) about migrating from Parse, we can help you get your data moved over, cloud code moved over and set up your Parse hosting on a new web host.

Your code won't even have to change as the Flybase work is handled in the backend of our modified Parse Server code. We can also help you set up a push notification replacement to work with your Parse apps.

Jason Fried:

> When 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 does not equal 60
> 
> Remember the first time someone asked you what’s heavier — a pound of feathers or a pound of lead? You probably fell for it. I sure did.
> 
> A pound is a pound! Duh!
> 
> But the same thing doesn’t apply with an hour. Every hour may be 60 minutes total, but that’s where the similarities end.
> 
> [..]
> 
> Time is the most precious thing there is, yet we split it up and give it away like there’s an endless supply. And whatever time you do have, you have even less attention.
> 
> So… Guard your big rocks. Hoard them. Protect them. Don’t let the job crush them into smaller and smaller pieces. And if you’re a manager, team lead, or owner of a business, make it a top responsibility to protect and preserve your people’s time and attention. Treat it as the most precious resource there is. Because it is.

Good advice as usual from Jason.

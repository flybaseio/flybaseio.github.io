> Business cards have a richer history than you might think. It turns out they’re descendents of a centuries-old ‘visiting card’ tradition, which originated in 17th-century France. Back then, people left their visiting cards in silver trays kept in the entry-area hallways of homes they stopped into. These small, paper cards — each adorned with the owner’s name — allowed homeowners to keep track of who visited and to whom reciprocal visits were owed. By the 19th century these cards were all the rage among upper-class society. Kaiser Wilhelm had one. Napoleon had one. Abraham Lincoln had a few made in his image.

Ryan Holmes:

> Business cards have a richer history than you might think. It turns out they’re descendents of a centuries-old ‘visiting card’ tradition, which originated in 17th-century France. 
> 
> Back then, people left their visiting cards in silver trays kept in the entry-area hallways of homes they stopped into. These small, paper cards — each adorned with the owner’s name — allowed homeowners to keep track of who visited and to whom reciprocal visits were owed. 
> 
> By the 19th century these cards were all the rage among upper-class society. [Kaiser Wilhelm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visiting_card#/media/File:Visiting_Card_of_Kaiser_Wilhelm.jpg) had one. Napoleon [had one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carte_de_visite#/media/File:Napoleon_III,_CDV_by_Disderi,_1859-retouch.jpg). Abraham Lincoln [had a few](http://www.philaprintshop.com/images/linccdv04.jpg) made in his image.
> 
> Then during the Industrial Revolution, emerging entrepreneurs — faced with a constant need to exchange contact information for business — came up with a new iteration. Printed on plain, heavy paper with utilitarian lettering, these more proprietary cards were [the first version](https://paysavvy.com/history-business-card/) of the modern business card as we know it.
> 
> But enough with the history lesson. What I want to know is why are we still stuck on this largely unchanged, archaic business tool? I personally don’t have a business card — and haven’t for years. I discovered early on that in the tech industry it’s rare you’ll ever need one. But looking beyond Silicon Valley, I think it’s time we all ditched business cards for good.

Ryan has a few points here, business cards have been around for a long time. A very, very long time, and it's time someone figured out exactly what needs to happen to turn that industry upside down.

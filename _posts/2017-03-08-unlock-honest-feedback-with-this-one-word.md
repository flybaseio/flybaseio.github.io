Claire Lew:

> A few years ago, a CEO told me how she was struggling to get honest feedback from her board.
> 
> No one seemed willing to be critical or give her pointers on things she could improve. After every board meeting, she would turn to them and ask directly:
> 
> > “What feedback does anyone have for me?”
> 
> She’d hear crickets. Every single time.

Good advice for getting feedback.

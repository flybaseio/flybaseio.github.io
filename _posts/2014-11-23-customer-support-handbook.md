This book came up in a conversation a couple weeks ago at the AWS re:Invent conference, I recommended it to a couple people and they loved it.

Sarah Hatter has been involved in customer support for years and has taken her experience and placed it in book form so everyone can learn from it. We've been using this book as we build our support system and have it on the reading list for everyone involved in Data McFly infrastructure to read.

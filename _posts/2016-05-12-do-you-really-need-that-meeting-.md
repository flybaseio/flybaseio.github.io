But it’s a mistake to assume everyone needs to be on the same page at all times. Great companies contain many pages. The art is knowing who needs to be on each one at any given time.

We use Slack for a lot of our meetings and standups here, since we're entirely remote it's nice to be able to just message about something. Otherwise, we use Slack's call feature when we need to talk, or hangouts when we need face to face but mostly a good Slack chat gets everything out there. 

I've worked places where everything involved a massive multi-hour meeting to decide on something as simple as logo placement, so I've been on both sides of the meeting debate, even meetings to debate if we need meetings.

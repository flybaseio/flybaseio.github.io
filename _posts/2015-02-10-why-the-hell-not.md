Jason Fried:

> Whenever I dive into something new, I try to find at least one “why the hell not?” moment. And when I can, I try to leave evidence of that moment in whatever it is that I’m building.

> When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched [a black and white, text-only site](http://37signals.com/manifesto) without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only?

> Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us.

> Whenever I’m struggling with a decision that seems “unusual”, I’ll look back at these two pages in REWORK and remind myself that just because everyone else does something one way doesn’t mean you have to do it that way. Sometimes it’s just worth saying why the hell not and going for it.

Jason has some good points in this post, asking yourself "why the hell not?" is a good question to ask before doing something.

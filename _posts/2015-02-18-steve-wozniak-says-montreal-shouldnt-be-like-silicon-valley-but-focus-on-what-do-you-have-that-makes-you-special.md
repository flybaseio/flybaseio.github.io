> Seve Wozniak and Steve Jobs helped bring the computer to everyday people. Woz is largely credited to be the designer of the first personal computer, the Apple 1 in 1976. Since, Apple has evolved and led the tech industry by creating products such as the iMac, MacBook, iPod, iPhone and iPad.
> 
> Wozniak was a guest speaker at an event organized by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal on February 16th. Wozniak, who is commonly known as Woz, spoke about the history of Apple, the future of technology and how Canada, specifically Montreal, can separate itself from all the clutter in the startup space.

> [When asked how Montreal](http://montrealgazette.com/business/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-to-montreal-dont-try-to-be-silicon-valley?__lsa=c817-32aa) can possibly become the next Silicon Valley, which is highly regarded as the place to go if you’re a startup, Wozniak stated, “You need to ask yourself what do you have that makes you special. Not how you can be a different place. The desire to search for something newer and better is part of our nature,” but is not limited by geography.

Data McFly isn't based in Montreal, we're in British Columbia, but the `What Do You Have That Makes You Special` question is a good one.

Location can help, but it isn't everything.

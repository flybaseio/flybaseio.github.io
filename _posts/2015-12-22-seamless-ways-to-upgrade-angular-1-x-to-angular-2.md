> Angular 2 was released a couple of months back and a beta version is just a couple of weeks old. Trust me, I can tell your thoughts about this change. You are probably asking yourself (or actually your computer screen) why on earth would the Angular team make such a huge jump. After all, you are (or at least you think you are) fine with what you already have in Angular 1.

Interesting article showing how `ng-forward` works for integrating angular 2 code styles into angular 1 apps with the idea of slowly upgrading your existing angular 1 apps towards angular 2.

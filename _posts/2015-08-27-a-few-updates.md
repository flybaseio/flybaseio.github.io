We've been making some updates across the site over the past couple weeks, and I wanted to mention them.

Most of our changes have been minor, as we get ready to roll out our new home page and dashboard but one change is a new [Developer Docs](http://docs.flybase.io/) site.

Previously, our developer docs were part of the Flybase site as `/docs` but we've decided to make this its own site, so we can grow it into a nice learning resource.

Last week we also pushed out some updates to our web and Node.js libraries and overall, we're excited about the changes we've got in the pipeline.

Also, we're about the announce book 2 in the Flybase ebook series, which will be geared towards developing Ionic apps with Flybase, so stayed tuned. :)

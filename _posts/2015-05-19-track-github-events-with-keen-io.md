We use several tools here at Data McFly, [Keen.io](http://keen.io) and GitHub are just two of those.

We also make heavy use of dashboards to show us various metrics, and that's where Keen is handy.

When I came across this post from [Heitor T. Sergent](https://medium.com/azuki-news/track-github-events-with-keen-io-in-3-steps-df6e3248387c), it was close enough to what we do that I thought I'd share it.

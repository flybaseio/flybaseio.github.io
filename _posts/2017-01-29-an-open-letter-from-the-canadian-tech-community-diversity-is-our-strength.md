> The Canadian tech community comprises many different nationalities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, mental and physical abilities, and perspectives. We believe that this diversity is a source of strength and opportunity.
> 
> On this topic, we are united.
> 
> Canadian tech companies understand the power of inclusion and diversity of thought, and that talent and skill know no borders. In choosing to hire, train, and mentor the best people in the world, we can build global companies that grow our economy. By embracing diversity, we can drive innovation to benefit the world.
> 
> The 21st century will be driven by pluralistic economies powered by pluralistic societies.
> 
> This is a belief founded upon personal experience for many in our community. Many Canadian tech entrepreneurs are immigrants, are the children of immigrants, employ and have been employed by immigrants.
> 
> As connected economies, decisions by the United States can directly impact every business north of the border. The recently signed Executive Order to block entry of citizens from seven countries has already impacted several in our community. As a community, we are all affected.
> 
> As a community, we stand together in opposition to the marginalization of people based on their birthplace, race, or religion.
> 
> The Canadian tech community supports [Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s message](https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816) that Canada will and must remain inclusive to all nationalities. We also stand directly opposed to any and all laws that undermine or attack inclusion, and call on Prime Minister Trudeau and our political leaders to do the same.

We've signed the open letter, one of 1297 other signatures on the list and 1 of the 881 Canadian companies who have signed at the time I shared this post.

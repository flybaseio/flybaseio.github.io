The post we are linking to was published back in March, but it's relevant to today and what we are building, hence why we are sharing it.

We've been there ourselves, having been building various apps since the late nineties in various capacities, this is a feeling that is all too familiar.

Data McFly's data services are stable, and have been around for a year for our own personal projects before deciding to launch it as a backend service for other developers.

> Ignoring the cloud or web services because they are out of your comfort zone is no longer an option. The app economy is shifting. Adapt or die.

This is true, and we have been building our service to be easy to work with regardless of your development skills. 

At launch, we plan to have adapters for:

<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>PHP</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Ruby</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Node</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Javascript (jQuery)</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>AngularJS</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Python</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>iOS</li>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Android</li>
</ul>

This lets us work with the majority of web apps, and since we are a REST API service, it also helps us be easy to adapt to other platforms as well.

In fact, thanks to our usage of our system over the past year, we're already running on several of these platforms, as we've integrated heavily into several web and mobile apps.

And of course, any languages we miss, the community is welcome to write. :)

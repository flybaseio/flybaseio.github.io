Des Traynor at Intercom recently did a podcast with Margaret Gould Stewart, directory of product design at Facebook. It's an interesting podcast and worth a listen to.

> [Margaret Gould Stewart](https://twitter.com/mags) has more than 15 years experience leading design, research and UX teams at some of the world’s most influential tech brands.
> 
> Currently Director of Product Design at Facebook, Margaret oversees UX for all of the company’s ad products (mobile alone is a $2.9-billion business). She previously held senior user experience roles at YouTube and Google, and you might have caught her giving a [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_gould_stewart_how_giant_websites_design_for_you_and_a_billion_others_too) or [two](https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_stewart_how_youtube_thinks_about_copyright).
> 
> I caught up with Margaret to talk about the pressure of designing products for more than one-sixth of the world’s population, where design concepts differ and overlap in consumer and business products, and how to maintain a high bar for quality while scaling a creative team.

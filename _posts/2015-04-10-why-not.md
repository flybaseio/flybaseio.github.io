Seth Godin:

> If technology gives you the chance to speak up, build a platform and help show the way, why not use it?
> 
> If someone offers you a project or a job with more leverage and the chance to both learn and teach, why not take it?
> 
> If you can learn something new, more efficiently than ever before, if the opportunity to leap presents itself, why not?
> 
> Now is a good time.

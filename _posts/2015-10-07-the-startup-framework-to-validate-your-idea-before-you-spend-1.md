Mitchell Harper:

> “If your startup failed, it’s because it didn’t solve a tier 1 problem for a large enough audience — here’s how to never make that mistake again.”
> 
> Today I want to share the simple framework we used to validate our first idea, in the hopes that it will help other entrepreneurs avoid failure.
> 
> For reference, this is the exact same framework we used to validate the idea for Bigcommerce (which I co-founded) back in 2009. Today Bigcommerce has over 100,000 paying customers, 500 employees and $125M in VC raised.
> 
> Validating the demand for your product is more important than ANYTHING. More important than features, your team, design, pricing, etc.
> 
> Without market validation you’ll have a product that no one will pay for. You’ll burn a lot of time, energy and cash and you’ll end up stressed, probably depressed and definitely burned out.
> 
> And that hurts — a lot.
> 
> OK so let’s get to it — here’s how to validate your startup idea before you launch. Before you invest or raise $1. Before you hire anyone.

This is an interesting framework that is a handy reference when building a startup. We used a similar framework when we built Flybase, and with our upcoming companion service.

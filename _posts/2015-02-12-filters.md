Most of our users handle their data from our API, but sometimes you find yourself using the dashboard, until today, we displayed data inside each collection as a paginated list of data that you could click each post to edit.

One of the items we've always had on our todo list was to let users filter data that is displayed, so they could create queries, order data, etc.

Today, we've pushed this update to the dashboard area for all users to enjoy.

Since the dashboard is built on top of our API, these filters work the same way our API queries work, so this can be handy for making sure your queries will acheive the desired results or just for filtering through pages of data quickly.

All in all, this is another feature to help make building your apps quicker.

I've known Jason for a few years now and thought this was a post worth sharing.

Here at Data McFly, we plan out what we are doing each day from writing on this blog, or the [book](http://blog.datamcfly.com/2015/03/04/real-time-web), to code updates.

From experience elsewhere over the years, we've seen what happens when you don't plan and so, we keep a schedule of everything we are doing as we do it.

There may occasionally be a surprise or two, but for the most part, our schedule works for us.

John Schnettgoecke:

> I had one of those want-to-pull-your-hair-out days on Monday. My brain seemed to fail me more often than I could count, and I was awake until 4:00 a.m early on Tuesday morning, mostly just sitting at my kitchen table tinkering unsuccessfully with a couple of projects.
> 
> I was caught somewhere in the middle between incredible enthusiasm and incredible stupidity — with every passing minute, it swung more toward the latter. You see, I actually wanted to be awake at that ungodly hour. I failed, failed and failed again, but I was learning.
> 
> I’ve really taken to this whole coding thing (so much so that it’s really the only thing I’m doing lately), but damn, it’s tough. If you’re really committed to learning to code, you learn to develop a support system for those dreadfully awful days.

Anyone who writes code has had one of these days, and John has posted a few handy steps to do when you hit a roadblock.

Des Traynor:

> A clichéd piece of advice is to ignore your competitors. It’s universally agreed on, yet ask any founder how their competitors are doing and you’ll see it’s almost universally ignored. They’ll fly through a list of players providing commentary quicker than a sports announcer.
>
> The cost of any success is that people copy you. If your “mix some photos with a song” app takes off, rest assured there’ll be twenty of them in the weeks to come, each with similar features, logos, names, and users.

Des may write some longer blog posts, but when he does, he writes posts that are worth making sure you read it.

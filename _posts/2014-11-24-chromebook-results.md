My [Chromebook experiment](http://blog.datamcfly.com/2014/11/10/coding-in-the-cloud) actually worked out great at the conference. My main dev IDE was [CodeAnywhere](http://codeanywhere.com/referralsignup/?r=20673c733e55333663) which worked well for coding.

It won't be able to replace my MacBook full time, but it can do the job nicely in a pinch.

The Chromebook I used was an [Acer C720P](http://amzn.to/1C7oehq), and when I first got it, I didn't picture using the touchscreen all that much, but it's managed to come in handy several times since then and is definitely a feature I've been enjoying.

2014 has exited the building and 2015 has begun. And we are looking forward to what the new year has to bring.

We're building a powerful real-time application platform, and it's no coincidence that we are launching in the new year. 

Our various helper libaries are near completion and we'll be pushing them live as we finish them.

So far, we have our Javascript / Node, PHP, and Python helper libraries ready to go.

Our Ruby, iOS and Android libraries are in the process of being finished up and will be done very shortly.

As we build our platform, we are talking to users and looking at what they want.

Our end result is a platform built for users, by users.

Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP Android, Chrome OS and Chromecast, writing on the Google Chrome blog:

> Over the last few days, there’s been some confusion about the future of Chrome OS and Chromebooks based on speculation that Chrome OS will be folded into Android. While we’ve been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS.

We're fans of ChromeOS here at Flybase, so it seemed worth sharing this latest post about Chrome OS.

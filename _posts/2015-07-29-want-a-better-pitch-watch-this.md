Andy Raskin:

> Three weeks ago, the CMO of a San Francisco startup backed by A-list investors emailed me about her new sales deck.
> 
> “It lacks oomph,” she said. “The information is there. The slides look great. But we’re not telling a compelling story. Can you help?”
> 
> One of my favorite things is helping entrepreneurs craft better pitches — for fundraising, sales, recruiting, whatever. I was busy with other projects and couldn’t start immediately, so I sent a link to the man on the CMO’s team who built the deck — a guy named Zack.
> 
> Five days later, the CMO texted me:
> 
> “Andy, what did you send Zack? Because his deck got a lot better. Kind of like night and day.”

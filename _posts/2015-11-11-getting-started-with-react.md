> When compared to other frontend frameworks available today, React’s existence seems a bit weird. React claims to be the “V” in MVC, but other frameworks like Angular, Backbone, and others already have a view layer that seems to work just fine. So why should we ever need to use React?

> It’s a great question, and by the end of this course, you’ll have a very firm understanding of the answer: React doesn’t want to replace your view layer — it wants to augment it. And React does an absolutely amazing job of this. Using React will very likely increase the speed and stability of the software you ship as well as completely change how you think about building frontend software.

If you've wanted to get into React, this tutorial from Thinkster is a good place to start.

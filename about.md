### What Is Flybase?

<img src="/images/datasm.png" class="logo" alt="Data McFly - Your Real-Time Superhero" style="width:30%;height: auto;float:left;"/>

[Flybase](http://flybase.io) is a real-time application platform. It allows developers to build real-time, collaborative apps using only client-side code, with the Flybase cloud servers acting as the app's backend.

Flybase provides an API that lets developers store application data in a data structure that is automatically synchronized to the Flybase cloud servers and to any other clients that are listening to changes on that data. 

This allows for writing data-driven single-page apps that update in real-time in response to other users' actions. 

We are excited to be building a platform that helps developers rapidly build applications of all types faster than ever before.

This blog is coded by hand in [Coda 2](http://panic.com/coda/) on a 13" MacBook Pro with Retina, and [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda) on an iPad Air 2. [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) is our app of choice to to draft and edit posts.

It is powered by a modified version of the [Camel.js](https://github.com/DataMcFly/camel/) blog engine by [Casey Liss](http://www.caseyliss.com/) and is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
